This respository provides training modules explaining how to design applications for the Intel Platform Acceleration Card (PAC).

Currently the repository includes explanations for writing RTL code, combined with C++, but will eventually be expanded to explain other design-entry methods including OpenCL and OpenVINO.

[For the RTL AFU and OPAE explanation, see the RTL/ directory.](RTL/)
