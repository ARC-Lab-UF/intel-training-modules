# Introduction

These examples illustrate how to perform timing optimization (or timing closure) using Intel Quartus software. The examples are designed to work on the Intel DevCloud, but can also be performed locally by installing Quartus.

The [examples](examples/) folder includes simple examples that explain the basics of timing optimization by identifying different types of timing bottlenecks and then resolving them.
