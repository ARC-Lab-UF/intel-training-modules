# Introduction

These examples illustrate simple circuits to better understand how to perform FPGA timing optimization. 
Each exercise has an unoptimized version to start with in the code/ directory, along with an optimized  solution in the solution/ directory. 
[It is highly recommended that you follow the suggested study order.](https://github.com/ARC-Lab-UF/intel-training-modules/tree/master/timing#suggested-study-order)
